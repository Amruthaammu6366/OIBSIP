      <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, known as A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, was a prominent Indian scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India. Born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he became a leading figure in India's space and missile programs. Kalam's career spanned from aerospace engineering to science administration, playing a key role in developing India's civilian space program and military missiles. He was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on developing ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor. Kalam also served as a mentor and source of inspiration for students and youth across the nation. He authored several books, including "Wings of Fire," which detailed his life and journey. Kalam's presidency (2002-2007) was marked by a focus on youth empowerment and national development. He passed away on July 27, 2015, at the age of 83. </p>
